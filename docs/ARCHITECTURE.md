# Smart Contract Architecture

## System Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ProxyAdmin] --> B[BaseStablecoin]
    A --> C[ComplianceRegistry]
    B --> D[USDC]
    B --> E[EURS]
    B --> F[JPY]
    C --> G[KYC Service]
    C --> H[AML Service]
    C --> I[Reporting Service]
```

## Core Components

### ProxyAdmin
- Manages upgrades for all contracts
- Implements timelock mechanism
- Controls emergency functions
- Manages access control

### ComplianceRegistry
- Centralized compliance management
- KYC/AML status tracking
- Regulatory reporting
- Transaction monitoring

### BaseStablecoin
- Core stablecoin functionality
- Upgrade mechanisms
- Compliance integration
- Emergency controls

## Security Architecture

### Access Control Layer
```mermaid

    A[User] --> B[Access Control]
    B --> C[Role Manager]
    C --> D[Permissions]
    D --> E[Functions]
```

### Upgrade Process
```mermaid

    A[Deploy New Implementation] --> B[Request Upgrade]
    B --> C[Timelock Period]
    C --> D[Security Checks]
    D --> E[Execute Upgrade]
```

## Data Flow

### Transaction Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Stablecoin
    participant Compliance
    participant Registry
    
    User->>Stablecoin: Request Transfer
    Stablecoin->>Compliance: Check Requirements
    Compliance->>Registry: Verify Status
    Registry-->>Compliance: Return Status
    Compliance-->>Stablecoin: Approve/Reject
    Stablecoin-->>User: Complete Transfer
```

## Integration Points

### External Services
- KYC Provider Integration
- AML Monitoring
- Regulatory Reporting
- Price Feeds

### Internal Services
- Transaction Monitoring
- Compliance Reporting
- Emergency Response
- Upgrade Management

## Storage Layout

### Proxy Storage
```solidity
contract StablecoinStorage {
    // Core storage
    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances;
    uint256 private _totalSupply;
    
    // Compliance storage
    mapping(address => bool) public isWhitelisted;
    mapping(address => bool) public isBlacklisted;
    
    // Upgrade storage
    address private _implementation;
    address private _admin;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Error Codes
| Code | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| E001 | Invalid compliance status | Verify KYC/AML |
| E002 | Transfer limit exceeded | Check limits |
| E003 | Upgrade failed | Verify implementation |
| E004 | Emergency pause | Wait for resolution |

## Gas Optimization

### Strategies
1. Batch operations
2. Storage packing
3. Memory vs Storage optimization
4. Loop optimization

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Transaction volume
- Gas usage
- Error rates
- Compliance status
