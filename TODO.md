## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1. Contract Security
   ```solidity
   // Implement UUPS proxy pattern
   contract UpgradeableStablecoin is UUPSUpgradeable {
       function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override onlyRole(UPGRADER_ROLE) {}
   }
   ```

2. Compliance Integration
   ```solidity
   // Add compliance checks
   function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
       require(complianceRegistry.isCompliant(from, to, amount), "Compliance check failed");
   }
   ```

3. Monitoring Setup
   ```javascript
   // Configure monitoring
   await monitor.setAlertThresholds({
       errorRate: process.env.ERROR_THRESHOLD,
       gasPrice: process.env.MAX_GAS_PRICE,
       transactionVolume: process.env.MAX_VOLUME
   });
   ```

4. Testing Infrastructure
   ```javascript
   // Add upgrade tests
   describe("Upgrade Process", function() {
       it("Should preserve state during upgrade", async function() {
           // Test implementation
       });
   });
   ```

## Dependencies
- OpenZeppelin Contracts ^4.9.0
- Hardhat ^2.17.0
- Ethers.js ^5.7.0
- Solidity ^0.8.19

## Notes
- All new features must include tests
- Documentation must be updated with changes
- Security review required for major updates
- Compliance checks must be maintained
